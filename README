Project:
Image classification on plankton dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/c/datasciencebowl

Plan:
1) Train own convnet on plankton dataset. 
  a) Divide the given train dataset in train and validation dataset.
  b) Train CNN (2-layer, 3-layer, 5-layer) on training dataset and evaluate performace on validation dataset.
  c) Use various CNN tricks to improve performance of this model on validation dataset.
  d) Use semantic and domain knowledge if possible.
2) Get the features (last relu activations) from this convnet and train linear classifier on top of it. See if accuracy is improved or not.
3) Add more features by running these images through various other neuralNets. (eg: get features (last relu activations) by running alexnet on these images. Train linear classifier with all additional features included.
